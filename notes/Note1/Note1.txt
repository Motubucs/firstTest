double jump has been fixed ðŸ˜€ but wall jump is clanky and very in-intuitive. needs either renovations or fixing
(the player is forced to push against the wall at a very particular position and speed. and also pushing against the
wall causes the player wall jump to lose momentum and worse reaction time
